# Normandy

Version:
0.2.1
The game:
You're the captain of the Normandy. A space ship. Whoop-dee-friggin-doo.
The game starts, you pick a name and get a randomly generated ship. Good luck not losing your first fight.
You have:
- armor (each has a different strength and weakness and hull health is randomly generated)
- missiles (limited amount but strong against certain armors)
- lasers (costs energy to fire, don't run out, there isn't a big downside to running out of energy but like, work with me here)
- a cargo bay (which is almost functional but not quite)
- a generator (generates energy, surprisingly)

You can: 
- scavenge (currently for absolutely nothing)
- explore (also for nothing)
- rest (to regenerate energy and lose 'heat')

Whoa! An enemy space ship! Hope you got a good randomly generated ship.
Now you can:
- scan the enemy (you get to see either their strength/weakness, the health of their hull or what their strongest weapon is)
- fire a missile (kaboom)
- fire a laser (pew pew)
- flee
- die

Congrats! You won! Nothing happens! But you go back to the game and I'm pretty sure your hull doesn't recharge yet. Haven't worked on an end-battle method yet.

This is the currently 'working' version (but it's crap), but it's not in any kind of releasable state yet. Not by far.
For future plans, in progress and semi-done functions, check "Projects", under "Release". If you have ideas, feel free to shoot me a message if you figure out how. I'll find it eventually.
