# Normandy

Version:
0.5.0
BAM! A frame.
Still the captain of the same damn ship. The game starts, you pick your name and a big-ass frame pops up.
Now, if you look to the left, you see your stats. Won't tell you much, I'll probably translate this to useful info later.
And to the right you see your text screen. At the top you can type in your commands. Start typing.
Outside of encounters you can scavenge, explore and rest, while in encounters you can fire missiles or lasers, scan the enemy or flee.
The battle system has been tweaked a bit, a few more functions have been added such as actual functional scavenging.
The cargo bay has been added but can't be seen yet. Working on that.
For more info you can see Projects.

Version:
0.2.1
The game:
You're the captain of the Normandy. A space ship. Whoop-dee-friggin-doo.
The game starts, you pick a name and get a randomly generated ship. Good luck not losing your first fight.
You have:
- armor (each has a different strength and weakness and hull health is randomly generated)
- missiles (limited amount but strong against certain armors)
- lasers (costs energy to fire, don't run out, there isn't a big downside to running out of energy but like, work with me here)
- a cargo bay (which is almost functional but not quite)
- a generator (generates energy, surprisingly)

You can: 
- scavenge (currently for absolutely nothing)
- explore (also for nothing)
- rest (to regenerate energy and lose 'heat')

Whoa! An enemy space ship! Hope you got a good randomly generated ship.
Now you can:
- scan the enemy (you get to see either their strength/weakness, the health of their hull or what their strongest weapon is)
- fire a missile (kaboom)
- fire a laser (pew pew)
- flee
- die

Congrats! You won! Nothing happens! But you go back to the game and I'm pretty sure your hull doesn't recharge yet. Haven't worked on an end-battle method yet.

This is the currently 'working' version (but it's crap), but it's not in any kind of releasable state yet. Not by far.
For future plans, in progress and semi-done functions, check "Projects", under "Release". If you have ideas, feel free to shoot me a message if you figure out how. I'll find it eventually.
